# Regression_Model_Student_Performance_Prediction

### Introduction:

In the realm of education, predicting student performance can be crucial for educators, policymakers, and students themselves. By understanding the factors that influence academic success, educators can tailor interventions and support mechanisms to enhance student outcomes. In this project, we aim to develop a Linear Regression Model for predicting student performance based on various factors such as hours studied, previous scores, extracurricular activities, sleep hours, and sample question papers practiced.

### Problem Statement:

The objective of this project is to build a predictive model that can accurately forecast student performance based on several input variables. These variables include:

- Hours Studied: The number of hours a student spends studying per week.
- Previous Scores: The scores achieved by the student in previous examinations.
- Extracurricular Activities: Whether the student participates in extracurricular activities (Yes/No).
- Sleep Hours: The average number of hours of sleep the student gets per night.
- Sample Question Papers Practiced: The number of sample question papers the student practices as part of their preparation.

Using this dataset containing 1000 entries with these variables along with the corresponding Performance Index, I aim to train a Linear Regression Model. This model will then be able to predict the performance index of students based on these factors.

### Following steps are followed in the case study

- Reading, Understanding and the data
- Visualising the data
- Preparing the data for modelling (train-test split, rescaling etc.)
- Training the model
- Prediction and evaluation on the test set
